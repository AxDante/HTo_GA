# MSR_MOGA

MSR_MOGA is a Multi-objective Genetic-Algorithm (MOGA) based path planning approach for modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRs). The program introduces customized reproduction operators and implemented revised NSGA-II technique to approach the multi-objective path planning problem. The program is developed and simulated under Processing environment.
